# 📊 Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Data

This project is focused on analyzing the sentiment of Twitter data using machine learning techniques. The aim is to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral by leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Preprocessing of Twitter data (removing stop words, punctuation, etc.).
- Implementation of various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest.
- Evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Visualization of sentiment distribution.
